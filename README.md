# Wiitar

Wiitar connects a Nintendo Wii Guitar Hero controller to your Mac. Now you can play Frets on Fire, record directly into GarageBand, or use the guitar with any other application. Requires Mac OS X 10.4 or 10.5.

Wiitar maps the buttons of the Wii guitar controller--including the Whammy Bar and Strum button--to any keyboard keys.

- For each of the color keys, the Whammy Bar, and the Strum button, enter an alphanumeric key or select a special key from the list.
- The Whammy Bar slider sets the activation level for that key--the higher it is set, the further you must push to send the key.
- "Send Keys on Strum" waits until you press the strum button to actually press the keys (as in the Wii game); "Send Keys Immediately" activates the keys as soon as you press the buttons (for Frets on Fire).
